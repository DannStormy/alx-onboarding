This program will allow the input of two numbers and calculate the sum of their squares

function squareOfNumbers(input1, input2) {
    Calculate square of input2 by multiplying it with itself and save to const square1
    Calculate square of input2 by multiplying it with itself and save to square2
    const sumOfSquares equal to square1 + square2
    return sumOfSquares
}

print squareOfNumbers(input1, input2)
